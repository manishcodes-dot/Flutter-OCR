# Flutter-OCR
Overview
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts images of text—such as scanned documents, PDFs, or photos—into machine-readable, searchable, and editable digital text. It uses pattern recognition to identify characters, eliminating manual retyping, enhancing efficiency, and enabling data extraction from printed or handwritten documents. 
Key Aspects of OCR Technology

    How it Works: OCR software analyzes a document's structure, breaks it down into lines and characters, and compares these to font templates or uses AI to identify the text.
    Common Uses: Digitizing books, processing invoices/receipts, scanning legal documents, and enabling text extraction in images.
    Types:
        Pattern Recognition: Matches characters to a pre-defined database of fonts.
        Feature Detection: Uses algorithms to identify specific character features like curves, lines, and angles.
        AI/Deep Learning: Uses advanced neural networks for improved accuracy, especially with varied fonts or handwriting.
    Benefits: Saves time, reduces human error in data entry, and makes text in images searchable and editable. 

Common Applications

    Document Management: Converting scanned paper files into editable formats like Word or PDF.
    Banking: Processing checks and banking documents automatically.
    Data Extraction: Pulling specific data from invoices, forms, and receipts.
    Accessibility: Turning printed material into audiobooks or screen-readable text.
